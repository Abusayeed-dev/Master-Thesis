## Overview
This repository contains code and resources related to our master's thesis, which investigates Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) discussions in corporate earnings calls. The research employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze ESG communication trends, sentiment, and industry-specific patterns using a dataset of over 7,600 earnings call transcripts.

## Research Objectives
1. **Analyze ESG Mentions**: Identify the frequency of ESG discussions in earnings calls across industries.
2. **Contextual and Sentiment Analysis**: Use Keyword-in-Context (KWIC) and sentiment analysis to determine how ESG topics are framed.
3. **Topic Modeling**: Apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover recurring ESG themes.
4. **Industry Comparison**: Develop a comparative framework to assess ESG discourse variations across different sectors.
5. **Temporal Trends**: Evaluate changes in ESG discussions over time to identify emerging trends.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Earnings call transcripts sourced from S&P Global (2021-2023).
- **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, removal of stopwords, and normalization.
- **Text Analysis Techniques**:
  - Frequency Analysis
  - KWIC Analysis
  - Sentiment Analysis (Loughran-McDonald Dictionary)
  - Topic Modeling (LDA)
  - Bigram and Network Analysis
  - Word Cloud Visualization

## Key Findings
- ESG discussions are increasing across industries, with sectors like software, biotechnology, and waste management leading the trend.
- Most companies present ESG topics in a positive light, highlighting compliance, innovation, and sustainability initiatives.
- Topic modeling reveals core ESG concerns, including carbon footprint reduction, governance policies, and social responsibility.
- The financial sector emphasizes ESG in terms of sustainable investing, while technology sectors focus on security and digital transformation.
